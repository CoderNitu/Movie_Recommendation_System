This is a project on Movie_Recommendation_System using Machine Learning with python.....
I have used google colab to create this project. You can go the file and directly go to google colab to run this project.
I have uploaded the datasheet that i have used . You can also used different datasheet from website www.kaggle.com.
This recommendation system is mainly based on content-based or popularity-based recommendation system where an user can give the name of their favorite movie and it will suggest the best possible similarity movie that the user like .
The algorithm used here is cosine similarity algorithm . No machine learning model is used here.
